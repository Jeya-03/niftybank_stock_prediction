#Nifty Bank Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms

##Overview:

This repository contains the code and data for a study that analyzes the accuracy of three machine learning and deep learning algorithms in forecasting Nifty Bank stock prices on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India. The algorithms evaluated in this study are:
GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
Linear Regression
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

##Abstract:

This study analyzes the accuracy of three machine learning and deep learning algorithms in forecasting Nifty Bank stock prices on the NSE: GRU, Linear Regression, and LSTM. All models are trained and evaluated using a large amount of historical data, and their efficacy is determined by evaluation metrics. The LSTM algorithm provides better accuracy in capturing temporal correlations, according to the results, whereas GRU delivers comparable accuracy but requires shorter training durations. Even though it is easier, linear regression produces accurate results than the other two algorithms as per experiment. These discoveries aid in the creation of trustworthy prediction models and provide insightful information to investors, financial analysts, and legislators so they may make wiser investment choices.

##Requirements:

1. Google Colab

##Results:

a.LSTM: Best at capturing temporal correlations, highest accuracy.

b.GRU: Comparable accuracy to LSTM, shorter training duration.

c.Linear Regression: Easier to implement, provided accurate results in experiments.

##Conclusion:

The results of this study suggest that LSTM is the most effective algorithm for predicting Nifty Bank stock prices.. Linear Regression, provided better valuable predictions.
